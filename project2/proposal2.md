# Is age and cohort related to divorce

#### Filipe F. Borba

3) What dataset(s) are you planning to work with?  What is the current status of the data: Do you have it in hand?  Do you know where to get it from?  Are you looking for data?  What are the terms of use and restrictions on the data?  Is there anything you are not allowed to do with it?  Is there anything you should not do with it because of ethical concerns?  (NOTE: Please don't say there are no ethical concerns.  There are ALWAYS ethical concerns)

I am using the  National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) dataset provided by [Allen Downey's repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/MarriageNSFG). It is a public dataset, so it is free for use. I need to credit them for providing the dataset and canâ€™t try to identify any of the people surveyed. It should only be used for research or statistical purposes.

The goal of the project is to identify differences in divorces across cohorts using survival analysis. Also, use Cox regression (or Cox's proportional hazard model) to fit a model with explanatory variables (called covariates) to verify how we can explain variation in divorce rates.
