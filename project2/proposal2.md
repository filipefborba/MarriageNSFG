# Is age and cohort related to divorce?

#### Filipe F. Borba

I am using the  National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) dataset provided by [Allen Downey's repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/MarriageNSFG). It is a public dataset, so it is free for use. I need to credit them for providing the dataset and canâ€™t try to identify any of the people surveyed. It should only be used for research or statistical purposes.

The goal of the project is to identify differences in divorces across cohorts using survival analysis. Also, use Cox regression (or Cox's proportional hazard model) to fit a model with explanatory variables (called covariates) to verify how we can explain variation in divorce rates.
