# Is age and cohort related to divorce?

#### Filipe F. Borba

Marriages have been changing drastically over time: they are happening later than before. This change might lead us to assume that divorce rates are decreasing. To check this assumption, I used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) ranging from 2002 to 2017 cycles to identify differences in divorces across women born in different decades using survival analysis. I then verified there variations in divorce rates with Cox regression.

While sampling errors make it difficult to draw confident conclusions from the analysis, initial models suggest that women born during the 80s were more likely to divorce within the first 10 years of marriage, while those born in the 50s lasted longer initially, but ended with the lowest percentage still married (42%). By using only the ```agemarry``` variable for the Cox regression, there was a substantial spread from the Kaplan-Meier function and 0.63 concordance-index. ```agemarry``` has a coefficient of -0.10, about a 10% decrease in the baseline hazard, which means less at risk of the event (divorce) ocurring. The model suggests that women who married later in life tended to have longer lasting marriages, reducing the hazard of divorce by 10% per year for the model given. [Read more](./report2.md)
